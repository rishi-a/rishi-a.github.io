**TLDR**:
I love the fusion of **Electronics+Computer Science**. Also, just like Chris Olah says, *"I want to understand things clearly"*


I was recently shortlisted for Ph.D. admission at IIT Gandhinagar after clearing the written test and interview. Before this, I was working as a JRF in the same institute under <a href="https://nipunbatra.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Nipun Batra</a> since March 2019. From August 2018 to January 2019, I was a Research and Teaching Assistant at IIIT Sricity. Meeting and working under <a href="http://vvtesh.co.in" target="_blank">Prof. Venkatesh Vinayakarao</a> was the most fabulous thing that happened there. 

After my BTech in ECE at Gauhati University, I primarily worked for about 3.5 years in multiple organizations in the Web Design and Development domain (*I used to eat JavaScript*). I was even into freelancing. 3.5 years and I was done with those Jobs. I loved the 9-5 (or 9 to 6.30) culture but eventually thought that I did not want to continue that way. 

Government job was an excellent option to try. But the State Govt. is something I feel fishy about and the Central Government seems too good for a person like me. ;) 

So, Ph.D. seems to be what I wanted to do. I enjoy the essence of understanding complicated looking concepts. That mindful satisfaction is hard to explain. I think the following are useful points in favor of doing a Ph.D.

1. You never retire in the job you do after doing a Ph.D. Why? 

2. You do a Ph.D. to specialize in a domain where work is fun, and that is what you aspire to do in your entire life. 

3. Ph.D. is an excellent way to *satisfy the innate hunger* of understanding things clearly and explain those *things* in the most straightforward way to someone else.


So, that is it. I hope my journey will be fulfilling. I know it will be full of challenges and pressure, but anything worth having is difficult to have, and it is climbing that mountain that is important.
